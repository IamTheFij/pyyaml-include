An extending constructor of [PyYAML][]: include other [YAML][] files into [YAML][] document.

## Install

```sh
pip install "pyyaml-include>=2.0"
```

## Basic Usages

Consider we have such [YAML] files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ 0.yml
â””â”€â”€ include.d
    â”œâ”€â”€ 1.yml
    â””â”€â”€ 2.yml
```

- `1.yml` 's content:

  ```yaml
  name: "1"
  ```

- `2.yml` 's content:

  ```yaml
  name: "2"
  ```

To include `1.yml`, `2.yml` in `0.yml`, we shall add `YamlInclude` to [PyYAML]'s loader, then add an `!inc` tag in `0.yaml`:

```python
import yaml
from yamlinclude import YamlInclude

# add the tag
yaml.add_constructor(
    tag="!inc",
    constructor=YamlInclude(base_dir='/your/conf/dir'),
    Loader=yaml.Loader
)

with open('0.yml') as f:
    data = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.Loader)

print(data)

# remove the tag
del yaml.Loader.yaml_constructors["!inc"]
```

### Include in a Mapping

If `0.yml` was:

```yaml
file1: !inc include.d/1.yml
file2: !inc include.d/2.yml
```

We'll get:

```yaml
file1:
  name: "1"
file2:
  name: "2"
```

### Include in a Sequence

If `0.yml` was:

```yaml
files:
  - !inc include.d/1.yml
  - !inc include.d/2.yml
```

We'll get:

```yaml
files:
  - name: "1"
  - name: "2"
```

### Wildcards

File name can contain shell-style wildcards. Data loaded from the file(s) found by wildcards will be set in a sequence.

That is to say, a list will be returned when including file name contains wildcards.
Length of the returned list equals number of matched files:

- when only 1 file matched, length of list will be 1
- when there are no files matched, an empty list will be returned

We support `**`, `?` and `[..]`. We do not support `^` for pattern negation.
The `maxdepth` option is applied on the first `**` found in the path.

> â„¹ **Note**
>
> Using the `**` pattern in large directory trees or remote file system (S3, HTTP ...) may consume an inordinate amount of time.

If `0.yml` was:

```yaml
files: !inc include.d/*.yml
```

We'll get:

```yaml
files:
  - name: "1"
  - name: "2"
```

## Advance usages

### Work with fsspec

In `v2.0`, we use [fsspec][] to open including files, which makes it possible to include file from many different sources, such as local file system, S3, HTTP, SFTP ...

For example, we can include files in a website in YAML:

```yaml
conf: !inc http://domain/conf/*.yml
```

When creating a `yamlinclude` constructor, a [fsspec][] filesystem parameter can be set on `fs` argument to open including files. If the argument is omitted or `None`, a `"file"`/`"local"` [fsspec][] filesystem object will be used.

For example, when we want to include files from a website, we shall:

1. create a YAML-Include tag constructor, with a [fsspec][] HTTP filesystem object as it's `fs`:

   ```python
   import yaml
   import fsspec
   from yamlinclude import YamlInclude

   ctor = YamlInclude(
       fs=fsspec.filesystem(
           "http", client_kwargs=dict(base_url=f"http://{HOST}:{PORT}")
       ),
       base_dir="/foo/baz",
   )
   yaml.add_constructor("!inc", ctor, yaml.Loader)
   ```

1. then, write a [YAML][] document to include files from `http://${HOST}:${PORT}`:

   ```yaml
   doc1: !inc doc1.yml    # relative path to "base_dir"
   doc2: !inc ./doc2.yml  # relative path to "base_dir" also
   doc3: !inc /doc3.yml   # absolute path, "base_dir" is not effected
   doc3: !inc ../doc4.yml # relative path one level upper to "base_dir"
   ```

1. load it with `PyYAML`:

   ```python
   yaml.load(content, yaml.Loader)
   ```

Above [YAML][] snippet will be loaded as:

- `http://${HOST}:${PORT}/foo/baz/doc1.yml` for the key `doc1`
- `http://${HOST}:${PORT}/foo/baz/doc2.yml` for the key `doc2`
- `http://${HOST}:${PORT}/doc3.yml` for the key `doc3`
- `http://${HOST}:${PORT}/foo/doc4.yml` for the key `doc4`

### The base_dir argument

- If `base_dir` is omitted or `None`, the actually including file path is the path in defined in [YAML][] without a change, and different [fsspec][] filesystem will treat them differently. For a local filesystem, it will be `CWD`.
